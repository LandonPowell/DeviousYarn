# Dynamite
Dynamite - A compiled language fully implemented in ocaml.

Dynamite uses ocaml as it's implementation language and IR, therefore Dynamite is fully 
compatible with any and all ocaml code and libraries.

## Installing Dynamite's compiler on Linux or Cygwin

* Install ocaml, ocamlbuild, and opam.
* Move the `dynamite` executable into your `/usr/bin` folder.
* Run `mkdir /usr/lib/dy` with sudo.
* Move the `usr/lib/dy/standardlibrary.ml` into `/usr/lib/dy/standardlibrary.ml` with sudo.

### You now have a working installation of Dynamite.
