### DeviousYarn - The String Manipulation Oriented Language.

## What is DeviousYarn?
DeviousYarn is a computer language developed by Landon Powell for the purpose of 
String Manipulation. The DeviousYarn interpreter lies somewhere on the line 
between line editor and programming language interpreter.

## How do I install it?
Check your package manager's repos for the official DeviousYarn binary. 
If it doesn't exist, request it on their forums, or add one to their user repos.

## How do I compile it?
To compile DeviousYarn, choose one of the `DeviousYarn.*` files in the root 
of the repo, and then proceed to compile it normally. 

For example -
*`go build DeviousYarn.go`

Then, move the `DeviousYarn` binary generated by the compiler into your 
/usr/bin folder as `dy` using this command - 

`mv DeviousYarn /usr/bin/dy`

That's it!
